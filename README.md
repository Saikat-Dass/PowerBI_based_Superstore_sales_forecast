- The "Sum of Sales by Month and Year" and "Sum of Profit by Month and Year" charts indicate a clear seasonal pattern in both sales and profit.
- For the year 2020, sales and profit show a significant peak in the later months, specifically toward the end of the year. This suggests a strong holiday or year-end sales season.
- The map of the United States, labeled "Sum of Sales and Sum of Profit by State," visualizes sales performance across different states, showing a strong concentration of sales in certain areas. This chart can be used to identify top-performing states and regions.

<h2>Forecasted Insights :</h2>

- The sales data from January 2019 to January 2021 shows significant daily or weekly fluctuations. There is no clear, consistent upward or downward trend across the entire period, suggesting that sales can be unpredictable on a short-term basis.
- There appears to be a clear upward trend in sales towards the end of each year, particularly in late 2019 and late 2020. This indicates a seasonal pattern, likely tied to holiday shopping.
- The forecast represented by the shaded orange area, predicts that sales will decline in the upcoming month from the peak seen at the beginning of the new year.
  
<h2>Conclusion :</h2>

Historical profitability is skewed by a small set of discount-heavy categories and regions. Forecasting suggests that without discount policy correction and logistics optimization, future profits will degrade even if sales volume continues to grow.
